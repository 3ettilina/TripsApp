# Trips App
A Trips application using Flutter.

## What is this about?

This is my first beautifully styled Flutter app , which shows static data of a Trips app. 

My aim with this project is to get the fundamentals of a well structured and styled application using Flutter and Dart, in order to apply the skills on two College's projects I'm working on.

## Technologies
This project is fully made with:
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
* [Dart](https://dart.dev/)

No specific Android/iOS code was touched.

## Current status
This app is under development. 
Screenshots will be added on each big update, showing the corresponding current status.
